  TH FOR SOCKET 
  
  
  socket.on("active", ({ username, dbID }) => {
    users.push({ id: socket.id, username, dbID });
    socket.broadcast.emit(
      "status",
      users.map((user) => user.dbID)
    );
  });

heres a simple tipical use of a socket tho

I am emiting an event with name active from the client 
and along with it an object containing
 the keys username and dbID. 
 That object is destructrured in the callback 
 and I am using them however I want bellow. 
 In this case 
 I am emiting an event to 
 all the clients connected to the server at that moment
