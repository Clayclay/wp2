  @Clayclay  Then save your authstate in localstorage when user logged in, 
  so whenever you need it, you grab the data from localstorage. 
  and remove it when user logged out.

  TH FOR SOCKET 
  
  
  socket.on("active", ({ username, dbID }) => {
    users.push({ id: socket.id, username, dbID });
    socket.broadcast.emit(
      "status",
      users.map((user) => user.dbID)
    );
  });

heres a simple tipical use of a socket tho

I am emiting an event with name active from the client 
and along with it an object containing
 the keys username and dbID. 
 That object is destructrured in the callback 
 and I am using them however I want bellow. 
 In this case 
 I am emiting an event to 
 all the clients connected to the server at that moment
